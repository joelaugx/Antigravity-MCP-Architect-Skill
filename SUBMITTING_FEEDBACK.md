📝 MCP Development Experience Feedback

I've created comprehensive feedback on the MCP development experience based on real-world usage. 

Key points:
- MCP marketplace is great, but custom MCP creation is challenging
- Documentation gaps around troubleshooting, OAuth, and Python venvs
- Specific tooling recommendations (diagnostic CLI, scaffolding, etc.)

Full document: [link to GitHub or Google Doc]

Would love to discuss how we can make MCP development more accessible!

### Option 3: Email

If there's a feedback email:

**Subject**: MCP Documentation & Tooling Improvements - Community Feedback

**Body**:

```
Hi Antigravity Team,

I've been working extensively with MCPs and wanted to share detailed feedback on the developer experience for creating custom MCPs.

While the MCP marketplace and UI integration are excellent, I encountered several challenges when creating custom MCPs that could be addressed with improved documentation and tooling.

I've compiled comprehensive feedback with specific recommendations in the attached document. The feedback is based on real-world experience troubleshooting and configuring 8 different MCPs.

Key areas covered:
- Documentation gaps
- Troubleshooting challenges  
- Recommended tooling improvements
- Community resource needs

I've also created an open-source "MCP Architect" skill to help the community overcome these challenges, which could potentially be integrated into Antigravity or serve as a reference.

Happy to discuss any of these points further!

Best regards,
[Your name]

**Attach**: `ANTIGRAVITY_FEEDBACK.md`

### Option 4: Google Form / Feedback Portal

If Antigravity has a feedback form:

1. Fill out the form with summary
2. Upload `ANTIGRAVITY_FEEDBACK.md` as attachment
3. Select categories: Documentation, Developer Experience, Feature Request

## What to Include

When submitting, make sure to mention:

1. ✅ **Real-world experience**: Based on actual troubleshooting session
2. ✅ **Specific examples**: Google Drive MCP 404 error, OAuth setup, etc.
3. ✅ **Actionable recommendations**: Not just complaints, but solutions
4. ✅ **Community contribution**: MCP Architect skill as proof of concept
5. ✅ **Willingness to help**: Offer to contribute to documentation

## Follow-up Actions

After submitting:

1. **Monitor responses**: Check for team feedback or questions
2. **Engage with community**: See if others have similar experiences
3. **Update the skill**: Incorporate any official guidance that emerges
4. **Share learnings**: Blog post or tutorial based on the experience

## Alternative: Create Public Discussion

If you want to gauge community interest first:

1. **Post on Reddit**: r/LocalLLaMA, r/MachineLearning
2. **Tweet thread**: Share key points with #Antigravity #MCP
3. **Blog post**: Write up the experience and solutions
4. **YouTube video**: Walkthrough of creating a custom MCP

This can build community support for the improvements before formal submission.

## Expected Outcomes

**Best case**:

- Antigravity team implements some recommendations
- Documentation gets updated
- Diagnostic tools get built
- Community benefits

**Realistic case**:

- Feedback acknowledged
- Some improvements over time
- Community creates solutions (like MCP Architect skill)

**Worst case**:

- No response
- Community still benefits from the skill we created

## Timeline

- **Immediate**: Submit feedback via preferred channel
- **1 week**: Follow up if no response
- **1 month**: Evaluate if any changes were made
- **3 months**: Update skill based on any official improvements
